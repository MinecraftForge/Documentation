ModelBlocks
===========

The `ModelBlock` rendering system is new in Minecraft 1.8, and it greatly reduces the number of special cases in the code, and provides a nice architecture within which people can create interesting shapes without having to write a single line of (Java) code.
The vanilla wiki has a comprehensive overview of how to use this system from the user perspective over [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Models), and if all you need is a static block with one state, everything you need to know is on that page.
However, if you want to create an object that changes its state depending on how its placed or the world around it, it's time to roll up your sleeves and get ready to write some code.
