Introduction to blockstate JSONs
================================

Blockstate JSONs tell the game which model it should use depending on the values of the block's [blockstate properties][blockstate].
A simple block with no properties only has a "*normal*" blockstate which is its default.
A more complex block that can be displayed in different ways has so called *variants*.

As an example, let's take a look at the vanilla `oak_log.json`:

```json
{
    "variants": {
        "axis=y":    { "model": "oak_log" },
        "axis=z":     { "model": "oak_log_side" },
        "axis=x":     { "model": "oak_log_side", "y": 90 },
        "axis=none":   { "model": "oak_bark" }
    }
}
```

As you can see there is no normal state, only different variants depending on the value of "axis". Depending on which axis the log is aligned it will use either a model of the upright log, a model of the sideways log (rotated by 90Â° or not) or, should the block not have any axis set, it'll display the bark model which has the bark on all 6 sides.

The log only has one property: axis. A blockstate always has to be defined for all of its properties. This can quickly lead to a combinatorial explosion of variants. Let's look at one variant of the vanilla fence:

```json
"east=false,north=false,south=false,west=false": { "model": "oak_fence_post" }
```

It should also be noted that in vanilla blockstate JSONs, the property names must be in alphabetical order, keeping in mind that resource and property names must be lower case. This includes the blockstate variants (`"east=false"`) themselves.

And that is only one variant of 16. This can quickly lead to very big and verbose blockstate files, and is one of the main problems in Minecraft 1.8. Minecraft 1.9 will introduce a system that allows to get this under control. [Forge's Blockstate Json][forge] allows you to do so in 1.8.
