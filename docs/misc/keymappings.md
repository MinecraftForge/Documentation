# Key Mappings

A key mapping, or key binding, defines a particular action that should be tied to an input: mouse click, key press, etc. Each action defined by a key mapping can be checked whenever the client can take an input. Furthermore, each key mapping can be assigned to any input through the [Controls option menu][controls].

## Registering a `KeyMapping`

A `KeyMapping` can be registered by listening to the `RegisterKeyMappingsEvent` on the [**mod event bus**][modbus] only on the physical client and calling `#register`.

```java
// In some physical client only class

// Key mapping is lazily initialized so it doesn't exist until it is registered
public static final Lazy<KeyMapping> EXAMPLE_MAPPING = Lazy.of(() -> /*...*/);

// Event is on the mod event bus only on the physical client
@SubscribeEvent
public void registerBindings(RegisterKeyMappingsEvent event) {
  event.register(EXAMPLE_MAPPING.get());
}
```

## Creating a `KeyMapping`

A `KeyMapping` can be created using it's constructor. The `KeyMapping` takes in a [translation key][tk] defining the name of the mapping, the default input of the mapping, and the [translation key][tk] defining the category the mapping will be put within in the [Controls option menu][controls].

!!! tip
    A `KeyMapping` can be added to a custom category by providing a category [translation key][tk] not provided by vanilla. Custom category translation keys should contain the mod id (e.g. `key.categories.examplemod.examplecategory`).

### Default Inputs

Each key mapping has a default input associated with it. This is provided through `InputConstants$Key`. Each input consists of an `InputConstants$Type`, which defines what device is providing the input, and an integer, which defines the associated identifier of the input on the device.

Vanilla provides three types of inputs: `KEYSYM`, which defines a keyboard through the provided `GLFW` key tokens, `SCANCODE`, which defines a keyboard through the platform-specific scancode, and `MOUSE`, which defines a mouse.

!!! note
    It is highly recommended to use `KEYSYM` over `SCANCODE` for keyboards as `GLFW` key tokens are not tied to any particular system. You can read more on the [GLFW docs][keyinput].

The integer is dependent on the type provided. All input codes are defined in `GLFW`: `KEYSYM` tokens are prefixed with `GLFW_KEY_*` while `MOUSE` codes are prefixed with `GLFW_MOUSE_*`.

```java
new KeyMapping(
  "key.examplemod.example1", // Will be localized using this translation key
  InputConstants.Type.KEYSYM, // Default mapping is on the keyboard
  GLFW.GLFW_KEY_P, // Default key is P
  "key.categories.misc" // Mapping will be in the misc category
)
```

!!! note
    If the key mapping should not be mapped to a default, the input should be set to `InputConstants#UNKNOWN`. The vanilla constructor will require you to extract the input code via `InputConstants$Key#getValue` while the Forge constructor can be supplied the raw input field.

### `IKeyConflictContext`

Not all mappings are used in every context. Some mappings are only used in a GUI, while others are only used purely in game. To avoid mappings of the same key used in different contexts conflicting with each other, an `IKeyConflictContext` can be assigned.

Each conflict context contains two methods: `#isActive`, which defines if the mapping can be used in the current game state, and `#conflicts`, which defines whether the mapping conflicts with a key in the same or different conflict context.

Currently, Forge defines three basic contexts through `KeyConflictContext`: `UNIVERSAL`, which is the default meaning the key can be used in every context, `GUI`, which means the mapping can only be used when a `Screen` is open, and `IN_GAME`, which means the mapping can only be used if a `Screen` is not open. New conflict contexts can be created by implementing `IKeyConflictContext`.

```java
new KeyMapping(
  "key.examplemod.example2",
  KeyConflictContext.GUI, // Mapping can only be used when a screen is open
  InputConstants.Type.MOUSE, // Default mapping is on the mouse
  GLFW.GLFW_MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT, // Default mouse input is the left mouse button
  "key.categories.examplemod.examplecategory" // Mapping will be in the new example category
)
```

### `KeyModifier`

Modders may not want mappings to have the same behavior if a modifier key is held at the same (e.g. `G` vs `CTRL + G`). To remedy this, Forge adds an additional parameter to the constructor to take in a `KeyModifier` which can apply control (`KeyModifier#CONTROL`), shift (`KeyModifier#SHIFT`), or alt (`KeyModifier#ALT`) to any input. `KeyModifier#NONE` is the default and will apply no modifier.

A modifier can be added in the [controls option menu][controls] by holding down the modifier key and the associated input.

```java
new KeyMapping(
  "key.examplemod.example3",
  KeyConflictContext.UNIVERSAL,
  KeyModifier.SHIFT, // Default mapping requires shift to be held down
  InputConstants.Type.KEYSYM, // Default mapping is on the keyboard
  GLFW.GLFW_KEY_G, // Default key is G
  "key.categories.misc"
)
```

## Checking a `KeyMapping`

A `KeyMapping` can be checked to see whether it has been clicked. Depending on when, the mapping can be used in a conditional to apply the associated logic.

### Within the Game

Within the game, a mapping should be checked by listening to `ClientTickEvent` on the [**Forge event bus**][forgebus] and checking `KeyMapping#consumeClick` within a while loop. `#consumeClick` will return `true` only the number of times the input was performed and not already previously handled, so it won't infinitely stall the game.

```java
// Event is on the Forge event bus only on the physical client
public void onClientTick(ClientTickEvent event) {
  if (event.phase == TickEvent.Phase.END) { // Only call code once as the tick event is called twice every tick
    while (EXAMPLE_MAPPING.get().consumeClick()) {
      // Execute logic to perform on click here
    }
  }
}
```

!!! warning
    Do not use the `InputEvent`s as an alternative to `ClientTickEvent`. There are separate events for keyboard and mouse inputs only, so they wouldn't handle any additional inputs.

### Inside a GUI

Within a GUI, a mapping can be checked within one of the `GuiEventListener` methods using `IForgeKeyMapping#isActiveAndMatches`. The most common methods which can be checked are `#keyPressed` and `#mouseClicked`. 

`#keyPressed` takes in the `GLFW` key token, the platform-specific scan code, and a bitfield of the held down modifiers. A key can be checked against a mapping by creating the input using `InputConstants#getKey`. The modifiers are already checked within the mapping methods itself.

```java
// In some Screen subclass
@Override
public boolean keyPressed(int key, int scancode, int mods) {
  if (EXAMPLE_MAPPING.get().isActiveAndMatches(InputConstants.getKey(key, scancode))) {
    // Execute logic to perform on key press here
    return true;
  }
  return super.keyPressed(x, y, button);
} 
```

!!! note
    If you do not own the screen which you are trying to check a **key** for, you can listen to the `Pre` or `Post` events of `ScreenEvent$KeyPressed` on the [**Forge event bus**][forgebus] instead.

`#mouseClicked` takes in the mouse's x position, y position, and the button clicked. A mouse button can be checked against a mapping by creating the input using `InputConstants$Type#getOrCreate` with the `MOUSE` input.

```java
// In some Screen subclass
@Override
public boolean mouseClicked(double x, double y, int button) {
  if (EXAMPLE_MAPPING.get().isActiveAndMatches(InputConstants.TYPE.MOUSE.getOrCreate(button))) {
    // Execute logic to perform on mouse click here
    return true;
  }
  return super.mouseClicked(x, y, button);
} 
```

!!! note
    If you do not own the screen which you are trying to check a **mouse** for, you can listen to the `Pre` or `Post` events of `ScreenEvent$MouseButtonPressed` on the [**Forge event bus**][forgebus] instead.
