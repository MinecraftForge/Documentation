Mod Lifecycle
==============

During the mod loading process, the various lifecycle events are fired on the mod-specific event bus. Many actions are performed during these events, such as [registering objects][registering], preparing for [data generation][datagen], or [communicating with other mods][imc].

Event listeners should be registered either using `@EventBusSubscriber(bus = Bus.MOD)` or in the mod constructor:

```Java
@Mod.EventBusSubscriber(modid = "mymod", bus = Mod.EventBusSubscriber.Bus.MOD)
public class MyModEventSubscriber {
  @SubscribeEvent
  static void onCommonSetup(FMLCommonSetupEvent event) { ... }
}

@Mod("mymod")
public class MyMod {
  public MyMod() {
    FMLModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus().addListener(this::onCommonSetup);
  } 

  private void onCommonSetup(FMLCommonSetupEvent event) { ... }
}
```

!!! warning
    Most of the lifecycle events are fired in parallel: all mods will concurrently receive the same event.
    
    Mods *must* take care to be thread-safe, like when calling other mods' APIs or accessing vanilla systems. Defer code for later execution via `ParallelDispatchEvent#enqueueWork`.

Registry Events
---------------

The registry events are fired after the mod instance construction. There are two: `NewRegistryEvent`, `DataPackRegistryEvent$NewRegistry` and `RegisterEvent`. These events are fired synchronously during mod loading.

`NewRegistryEvent` allows modders to register their own custom registries, using the `RegistryBuilder` class.

`DataPackRegistryEvent$NewRegistry` allows modders to register custom datapack registries by providing a `Codec` to encode and decode the object from JSON.

`RegisterEvent` is for [registering objects][registering] into the registries. The event is fired for each registry. 

Data Generation
---------------

If the game is setup to run [data generators][datagen], then the `GatherDataEvent` will be the last event to fire. This event is for registering mods' data providers to their associated data generator. This event is also fired synchronously.

Common Setup
------------

`FMLCommonSetupEvent` is for actions that are common to both physical client and server, such as registering [capabilities][capabilities].

Sided Setup
-----------

The sided-setup events are fired on their respective [physical sides][sides]: `FMLClientSetupEvent` on the physical client, and `FMLDedicatedServerSetupEvent` for the dedicated server. This is where physical side-specific initialization should occur, such as registering client-side key bindings.

InterModComms
-------------

This is where messages can be sent to mods for cross-mod compatibility. There are two events: `InterModEnqueueEvent` and `InterModProcessEvent`.

`InterModComms` is the class responsible for holding messages for mods. The methods are safe to call during the lifecycle events, as it is backed by a `ConcurrentMap`.

During the `InterModEnqueueEvent`, use `InterModComms#sendTo` to send messages to different mods. These methods take in the mod id that will be sent the message, the key associated with the message data, and a supplier holding the message data. Additionally, the sender of the message can also be specified, but by default it will be the mod id of the caller.

Then during the `InterModProcessEvent`, use `InterModComms#getMessages` to get a stream of all received messages. The mod id supplied will almost always be the mod id of the mod the method is called on. Additionally, a predicate can be specified to filter out the message keys. This will return a stream of `IMCMessage`s which hold the sender of the data, the receiver of the data, the data key, and the supplied data itself.

!!! note
    There are two other lifecycle events: `FMLConstructModEvent`, fired directly after mod instance construction but before the `RegisterEvent`, and `FMLLoadCompleteEvent`, fired after the `InterModComms` events, for when the mod loading process is complete.
