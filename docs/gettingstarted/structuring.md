Structuring Your Mod
====================

We'll look at how to organize your mod into different files and what those files should do.

Packaging
---------

Pick a unique package name. If you own a URL associated with your project, you can use it as your top level package. For example if you own "example.com", you may use `com.example` as your top level package.

!!! important

    If you do not own a domain, do not use it for your top level package. It is perfectly acceptable to start your package with anything, such as your name/nickname, or the name of the mod.

After the top level package (if you have one) you append a unique name for your mod, such as `examplemod`. In our case it will end up as `com.example.examplemod`.

The `mods.toml` file
-------------------

This file defines the metadata of your mod. Its information may be viewed by users from the main screen of the game through the Mods button. A single info file can describe several mods.

The `mods.toml` file is formatted as [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml), the example mods.toml file in the MDK provides comments explaining the contents of the file. It should be stored as `src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml`. A basic `mods.toml`, describing one mod, may look like this:
```toml
    # The name of the mod loader type to load - for regular FML @Mod mods it should be javafml
    modLoader="javafml"
    # A version range to match for said mod loader - for regular FML @Mod it will be the forge version
    # Forge for 1.14.4 is version 28
    loaderVersion="[28,)"
    # A URL to refer people to when problems occur with this mod
    issueTrackerURL="github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues"
    # If the mods defined in this file should show as seperate resource packs
    showAsResourcePack=false

    [[mods]]
      modId="examplemod"
      version="1.0.0.0"
      displayName="Example Mod"
      updateJSONURL="minecraftforge.net/versions.json"
      displayURL="minecraftforge.net"
      logoFile="assets/examplemod/textures/logo.png"
      credits="I'd like to thank my mother and father."
      authors="Author"
      description='''
      Lets you craft dirt into diamonds. This is a traditional mod that has existed for eons. It is ancient. The holy Notch created it. Jeb rainbowfied it. Dinnerbone made it upside down. Etc.
      '''

      [[dependencies.examplemod]]
        modId="forge"
        mandatory=true
        versionRange="[28,)"
        ordering="NONE"
        side="BOTH"

      [[dependencies.examplemod]]
        modId="minecraft"
        mandatory=true
        versionRange="[1.14.4]"
        ordering="NONE"
        side="BOTH"
```

The default Gradle configuration replaces `${file.jarVersion}` with the project version, but *only* within `mods.toml`, so you should use those instead of directly writing them out. Here is a table of attributes that may be given to a mod, where `mandatory` means there is no default and the absence of the property causes an error.

|     Property |   Type   | Default  | Description |
|-------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:------------|
|        modid |  string  | mandatory | The modid this file is linked to. |
|      version |  string  | mandatory | The version of the mod. It should be just numbers seperated by dots, ideally conforming to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). |
|  displayName |  string  | mandatory | The user-friendly name of this mod. |
| updateJSONURL |  string  |   `""`   | The URL to a [version JSON](autoupdate#forge-update-checker). |
|   displayURL |  string  |   `""`   | A link to the mod's homepage. |
|     logoFile |  string  |   `""`   | The path to the mod's logo. It is resolved on top of the classpath, so you should put it in a location where the name will not conflict, maybe under your own assets folder. |
|      credits |  string  |   `""`   | A string that contains any acknowledgements you want to mention. |
|      authors |  string  |   `""`   | The authors to this mod. |
|  description |  string  | mandatory | A description of this mod. |
| dependencies | [list] |   `[]`   | A list of dependencies of this mod. |

The Mod File
------------

Generally, we'll start with a file named after your mod, and put into your package. This is the *entry point* to your mod
and will contain some special indicators marking it as such.

What is `@Mod`?
-------------

This is an annotation indicating to the Forge Mod Loader that the class is a Mod entry point. The `@Mod` annotation's value should match a mod id in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml` file.

Keeping Your Code Clean Using Sub-packages
------------------------------------------

Rather than clutter up a single class and package with everything, it is recommended you break your mod into subpackages.

A common subpackage strategy has packages for `common` and `client` code, which is code that can be run on server/client and client, respectively. Inside the `common` package would go things like Items, Blocks, and Tile Entities (which can each in turn be another subpackage). Things like GUIs and Renderers would go inside the `client` package.

!!! note

    This package style is only a suggestion, though it is a commonly used style. Feel free to use your own packaging system.

By keeping your code in clean subpackages, you can grow your mod much more organically.

Class Naming Schemes
--------------------

A common class naming scheme allows easier deciphering of what a class is, and also makes it easier for someone developing with your mod to find things.

For Example:

* An `Item` called `PowerRing` would be in an `item` package, with a class name of `PowerRingItem`.
* A `Block` called `NotDirt` would be in a `block` package, with a class name of `NotDirtBlock`.
* Finally, a `TileEntity` for a block called `SuperChewer` would be a `tile` or `tileentity` package, with a class name of `SuperChewerTile`.

Appending your class names with what *kind* of object they are makes it easier to figure out what a class is, or guess the class for an object.
