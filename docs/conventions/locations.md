Locations
=========

Minecraft expects certain parts of your project to be in certain locations, such as textures and JSONs.

All locations and items covered in this page are relative to your `./src/main/resources/` folder.

### mcmod.info

The `mcmod.info` file is in the root directory.

### Blockstates

Blockstate definition files are in the JSON format and are in the `./assets/<modid>/blockstates/` folder.

### Localizations

Localizations are plain-text files with the file extension `.lang` and the name being their [language code](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488(v=cs.20).aspx) such as `en_US`.

!!! note

    If a `pack_format` of 3 is specified in a `pack.mcmeta` file, the language code should be lowercase.

They are located in the `./assets/<modid>/lang/` folder.

### Models

Model files are in JSON format and are located in `./assets/<modid>/models/block/` or `./assets/<modid>/models/item/` depending on whether they are for a block or an item, respectively.

### Textures

Textures are in the PNG format and are located in `./assets/<modid>/textures/blocks/` or `./assets/<modid>/textures/items/` depending on whether they are for a block or an item, respectively.
