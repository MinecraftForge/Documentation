# Conventions for Forge Mods
A few conventions have been assembled for Forge mods, and it is strongly recommended you follow them.

## Why?
Conventions are important for a number of reasons:

 - **Interoperability**. Some mods need to work with identifiers created by other mods, and this is made extremely difficult, if not impossible, if there is no method to the madness of the identifiers.
 - **Consistency**. It is much easier to help work on a mod you did not write if they use conventions consistent with the rest of the modding community.
 - **Stability**. Some characters are illegal in certain types of identifiers, and this may not always be obvious. With conventions, it's easy to see what is expected to be seen in any given identifier.

## How?
Over the next few pages, we will go over all of the assembled conventions for Forge modding.
You should try to follow all of them as closely as you can, as it makes everyone's life easier. Including yours.
