# Documentation
This is the official MinecraftForge documentation, located at https://docs.minecraftforge.net.

It is intended to provide detailed documentation of Forge development concepts. This does not include javadocs.

The intent with this is to create a curated *definitive* source of documentation for developing mods with Forge. It is not a Java language tutorial, and basic concepts of Java should not be part of this documentation. Excessive example code will be avoided in lieu of more thorough explanations.

Feel free to submit pull requests related to documentation of Forge development here. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Don't expect this to be constantly being updated, though we will try and remedy egregious errors more quickly.
