# Documentation
This is the Read the docs MinecraftForge documentation, located at https://mcforge.readthedocs.org.

It is intended to provide detailed documentation of Forge development. Javadocs will not be hosted here, however. They will be located at ...

The intent with this is to create a curated *definitive* source of documentation for developing mods with Forge. It is not a Java language tutorial though, and basic concepts of Java should not be part of this documentation.

Feel free to submit pull requests related to documentation of Forge development here.

Don't expect this to be constantly being updated, though we will try and remedy egregious errors more quickly.
