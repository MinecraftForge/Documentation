EventNature
===========

When you want to do something with an event, you register your subscription, and you set up your block of code that gets sun.
(More on the specifics elsewhere)

An event includes information about what is currently happening in the game. If the event is fired when the player is activating a block you can see the player, the block, the world and the coordinates.

Some events allow you to set what the output will be, or allow the game to progress as normal. Many events allow you to cancel anything from happening at all.

You are still at the mercy of what minecraft decides to do with the changed information you gave the event, and you may often not have access to everything that you want.
